C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python313\site-packages\pyannote\audio\core\io.py:212: UserWarning: torchaudio._backend.list_audio_backends has been deprecated. This deprecation is part of a large refactoring effort to transition TorchAudio into a maintenance phase. The decoding and encoding capabilities of PyTorch for both audio and video are being consolidated into TorchCodec. Please see https://github.com/pytorch/audio/issues/3902 for more information. It will be removed from the 2.9 release.
